title: Cessation of RTM Ubiquity development
---

h2. {{ page.title }}

It's become painfully obvious that development of Ubiquity RTM has slowed to a trickle.  This is largely because I have stopped using Firefox, and also to a lesser extent, RTM.  I am also finding that other projects are taking up much more of my time.

Consequently further development of Ubiquity RTM by myself is unlikely.  I shall keep the github project available for forking, and I will also endeavor to reply to emails should people have questions about the code and design.
