h2. {{ page.title }}

A new version of the upcoming RTM Ubiquity command is available for beta testing: "here":http://gist.github.com/138132.

The issues addressed are listed "here":http://github.com/garyhodgson/ubiquity-rtm-api/issues/closed#label/0.4.

The main reason for the release will be to mitigate the breakage that the forthcoming Ubiquity release (0.5) "will cause":http://github.com/garyhodgson/ubiquity-rtm-api/issues/#issue/11.  

Also worth noting, the documentation will be slightly out of date with this release. Fixing that is on the "to-do list":http://github.com/garyhodgson/ubiquity-rtm-api/issues/#issue/12.
