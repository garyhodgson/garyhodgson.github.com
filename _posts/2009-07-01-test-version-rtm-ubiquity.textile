title: Test Version of RTM Ubiquity 0.3.9 Available
---

h2. {{ page.title }}

A version of the upcoming RTM Ubiquity command is available for beta testing: http://gist.github.com/138132

Issues addressed are listed here: http://github.com/garyhodgson/ubiquity-rtm-api/issues/labels/0.3.9

The main reason for the release will be to mitigate the breakage that the forthcoming Ubiquity (0.5) release will cause.  

Also worth noting, the documentation will be slightly out of date with this release. Fixing that is on the to-do list.
